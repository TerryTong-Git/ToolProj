      "=== Answer ===\n",
      "  <think> Okay, I need to solve this production planning problem. Let me see the problem statement again. The\n",
      "  goal is to choose integer quantities x_j ≥ 0 to maximize the total profit, which is the sum of profit[j]\n",
      "  multiplied by x_j. But there are constraints: for each resource i, the sum of consumption[i][j] * x_j must be\n",
      "  ≤ capacity[i]. Also, there are upper bounds for each x_j given by upper_bounds. The answer should be the\n",
      "  maximum profit possible.  So given the input: profit = [6, 20] consumption = [[29, 27], [26, 4]] capacity =\n",
      "  [10, 5] upper_bounds = [3, 3]  Hmm. Let me break this down. There are two products (since profit has two\n",
      "  elements). Let's call them x0 and x1. Each has a profit of 6 and 20 respectively. The consumption matrix has\n",
      "  two resources. For resource 0, each unit of x0 consumes 29 units, and x1 consumes 27. For resource 1, x0 uses\n",
      "  26 and x1 uses 4. The capacities are 10 and 5 for the two resources. Also, each x_j can't exceed 3.  Wait, but\n",
      "  the capacities are 10 and 5. Let me check the constraints. For example, if I take x0 and x1, then:  Resource\n",
      "  0: 29*x0 + 27*x1 ≤ 10? That seems impossible because even x0=0 and x1=0 would sum to zero, but any positive x\n",
      "  would make the sum way larger than 10. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Are the capacities per\n",
      "  resource?  Wait, looking at the numbers again. The consumption values are like 29 and 27. The capacity is 10.\n",
      "  So even if x0 and x1 are zero, the sum is zero which is ≤ 10. But if you take x0=1, then 29*1 =29 which is way\n",
      "  more than 10. So perhaps there's a mistake in the problem? Or maybe I'm missing something. Wait, maybe the\n",
      "  numbers are different. Let me check again.  Wait the consumption matrix is [[29,27], [26,4]]. So for resource\n",
      "  0, the consumption for product 0 is 29, product 1 is 27. And the capacity for resource 0 is 10. So for any x0\n",
      "  ≥ 1, 29*x0 would be ≥29 which is way more than 10. Similarly for x1 ≥ 1, 27*x1 would be ≥27, which is more\n",
      "  than 10. So unless the x's are zero, the constraints for resource 0 can't be satisfied. But then the only\n",
      "  feasible solution is x0=0 and x1=0, which gives profit zero. But the upper bounds are [3,3], but if the\n",
      "  constraints are impossible to satisfy otherwise, then the maximum profit is zero. But that seems odd. Maybe\n",
      "  there's a typo in the problem? Or perhaps I misread the numbers?  Wait maybe the consumption matrix is\n",
      "  transposed? For example, perhaps the rows are resources and columns are products. So for resource 0, the\n",
      "  consumption for product 0 is 29, product 1 is 27. But with capacity 10, even x0=0 and x1=0 would satisfy the\n",
      "  constraint. But any x0 or x1 ≥1 would make resource 0's sum exceed 10. Therefore, the only feasible solution\n",
      "  is x0=0, x1=0. Which gives profit 0. But the upper bounds are [3,3], but they can't be used here because the\n",
      "  constraints are not met. So the answer is zero?  But why would the problem give such numbers? Maybe I made a\n",
      "  mistake. Let me check the problem again.  Wait, perhaps the capacity numbers are for each resource. Let me\n",
      "  recheck the problem statement.  Yes: the constraints are sum_j consumption[i][j] * x_j ≤ capacity[i]. So for\n",
      "  each resource i. So for resource 0, the capacity is 10. So for example, if x0 and x1 are both zero, the\n",
      "  constraint is satisfied. If either is positive, then their consumption multiplied by the x would be way over\n",
      "  10. For example, if x1 is 1, then 27*1=27>10. So no feasible solution except zero. Therefore, the maximum\n",
      "  profit is zero.  But that seems strange. How can that be? Let me check if there's any possible x values that\n",
      "  can satisfy the constraints. For example, if x0 and x1 are zero. Then the constraints are satisfied. So the\n",
      "  maximum profit is zero. But then why are the upper bounds given as [3,3]? Because even if you set x to 3, the\n",
      "  consumption would be way over. So the only feasible solution is zero. Hence, answer is zero.  But maybe\n",
      "  there's another resource constraint that allows something. Let's check resource 1. For resource 1, the\n",
      "  consumption for product 0 is 26, product 1 is 4. The capacity is 5. So even if x0 is 0 and x1 is 1, then 4*1=4\n",
      "  ≤5. So that's allowed. But for resource 0, that same x1=1 would cause 27*1=27>10. So the first constraint is\n",
      "  violated. Therefore, the only feasible solution is x0=0, x1=0. Hence, maximum profit is zero.  So the answer\n",
      "  should be 0. But maybe I'm missing something here. Let me check again.  Is there any combination of x0 and x1\n",
      "  (integers between 0 and 3) that satisfies both constraints?  Let's try x0=0, x1=0: yes. Profit 0.  What about\n",
      "  x0=0, x1=0. Any other possibilities?  For example, x0=0, x1=0. Any other x would require that for resource 0,\n",
      "  the sum is 29x0 + 27x1 ≤10. Since x0 and x1 are non-negative integers. Let's see, possible x0 and x1 must be\n",
      "  zero. Because 29*0 +27*0=0 ≤10. Any other value would make the sum higher. For example, x1=1 gives 27>10. So\n",
      "  no. So the only possible solution is x0=0 and x1=0. So the answer is 0.  Therefore, the maximum profit is 0.\n",
      "  So the code needs to model this. How to implement this? Well, since it's an integer programming problem,\n",
      "  perhaps using pulp. But given the constraints, the code would set up the problem, but the optimal solution\n",
      "  would be zero.  So the code would look like:  import pulp  def solution():     profit = [6, 20]\n",
      "  consumption = [[29, 27], [26, 4]]     capacity = [10, 5]     upper_bounds = [3, 3]          # Number of\n",
